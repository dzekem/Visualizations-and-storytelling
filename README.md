# Visualizations-and-storytelling

Data visualization has been a vital skill as it brings out a better understanding of the different features in a data set.
These relationships become more persuasive when in the form of graphs and charts. Also these findings must always be backedup 
with innovative and persuasive stories depending on the project target. 

### Below is a link to some visualizations I made with Tablleau.

One of these visualizations is analyzing U.S Chronic Disease dataset from HealthData.Gov. After ensuring the data is clean (ensuring no null values are in the data, well spelled words and corresponding data types to the different features) exploratory data analysis was then performed on it.

# Visualizations-and-storytelling

Data visualization has been a vital skill as it brings out a better understanding of the different features in a data set.
These relationships become more persuasive when in the form of graphs and charts. Also these findings must always be backedup 
with innovative and persuasive stories depending on the project target. 

### Below is a link to some visualizations I made with Tablleau.

### I. Considering the U.S Chronic Disease dataset from HealthData.Gov

For the visualization to be performed the data was first cleaned(ensuring no null values are in the data, well spelled words and corresponding data types to the different features) exploratory data analysis was then performed on it.

#### Some of the relations include:
1. Count per Disease : 
In this visualization (bar chat), all the counts for each disease were represented by a bar with the highest being the disease with the highest number of pupil. Diabetes was seen to be the disease with highest count followed by Chronic Obstructive pulmonary diseases. These two diseases at the top could help health personels better understand the diesases most common which will also prompt new innovative ideas on how these numbers could be reduced either by poor eating habits, lack of exercises and many others.

2. Disease vs Stratification : 
This visualization had to bring together gender, race and overall population to better understand how each group reacts to these diseases. TH4e trends still had no significant difference meaning the diseases don't have a particular group of persons it targets.

### II. Considering the sales dataset of a small business.

Some KPIs(Key Performance Indicators) were defined which had an influence on sales be it positively or negatively. They include:

1. Discount by Category : 
Every business always seeks for growth by increasing sales and also increasing profit. But from this visualization, more sales are generated when the discounts are greater which subsequently reduces the profit. Since increased discounts is always the best option for a buyer, this could be a strategy used to attract new customers and also keeping the old ones.

2. Discount by profit ratio : 
Increasing discounts drastically increases sales but yet lesser profits are made. This could be a way of attracting new customers like when out to create awareness of a new product because those high discounts will always attract many people to come and buy.

## Conclussions

From these visualizations, hidden information and relationships we never expected were found from which best decisions and innovative ideas of new and different strategies could be used either to reduce counts of persons with a particular disease for the U.S Chronic Disease dataset or measures in which sales and profit could be increased in a business by making the business have a healthy growth.
